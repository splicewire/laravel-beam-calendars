/**
 * **Every `#[ParticleOp]` this package declares carries an explicit `input:`.**
 *
 * ⚠️ This is a PACKAGE-LOCAL, STATIC guard, and both halves are the point.
 *
 * `Splicewire\Beam\Doctor\UndeclaredInputAudit` — the estate's instrument for this — reads the
 * BOOTED `ParticleOperationRegistry`, which is the right instrument in a host and blind here:
 * measured 2026-08-28, this package's own testbench registers **0** particle operations, so the
 * audit run from inside it reports a green PASS over an empty population. A false green is worse
 * than no check, which is why api-surface-coherence 121 refused to twin the audit statically inside
 * beam and put the guard where the declarations actually live instead. Beam's own `AuditScanPaths`
 * already names this fallback: the boot-time seam "is not a fleet-wide census", and a package not
 * installed in the host under audit is covered "by its own package-local tooling".
 *
 * Scope is deliberately this package's own source and nothing else — a guard, never a census.
 *
 * The three legal answers are a Data class-string, `false` ("accepts nothing", which the controller
 * then ENFORCES by rejecting a body), and — for an operation whose input is genuinely host-bound —
 * an entry in `UndeclaredInputAudit::ACKNOWLEDGED`. `null` is none of them: it is the undeclared
 * state, and it reads as unfinished work rather than as a decision.
